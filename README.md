- About me: I am currently a student with a huge intrest in computers and the world of technology. I come from a small town called Pontypridd in Wales and have always wanted to pursue computers ever since i was a child. I am eager to pursue a future in the world of computers which i find to be very intresting and challenging and i feel as if i could create something impactful that will be worth something.
- What I am doing : I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of South Wales. I have just started my first year and am hoping to achieve a undergraduate degree in Computer Science over the course of three years of study. This course will expose me to lots of areas in the world of computing such as programming, database design, computer security and application development as well as much more which will certainly help prepare me for a career involving computing in the near future.
- Skillset : I have some knowledge in Programming mainly in the C++ language and have a little experience with SQL and Python but am looking to expand my knowledge in University such as learning Javascript for example. I have also looked into other areas such as the use of cryptography and it's techniques and ethical concerns in the world of computing. I hope to make use of my time in university to vastly improve my skillset and learn new things for my own intrests in addition to gaining knowledge on pursuing a career in Computing.

- Hobbies : My hobbies mostly revolve around Computers I enjoy things such as video games and programming. I also have a intrest and am very knowledgeable on computer hardware and have assembled computers in the past with individual parts I am espically proud of my own PC which i saved up for and assembled with high-end parts which i now use everyday this took lots of planning and research and required me to understand exactly how computers function and each part. I also partake in weight training in my spare time as i feel physical fitness has a huge amount of benefits.

- Recent Projects Completed : I do not have many notable projects at the moment only very minor things however I am expanding my knowledge on C++ programming to hopefully create some in the future. I am also creating a database in university using SQL which is valuable knowledge to have. I have created some very small C++ projects in University which will help me to understand the fundamentals of programming and will eventually lead to more signficant projects.

Some notable small C++ projects i have completed include:
- A program that calculates an employees pay with numerous benefits this helped me gain an understanding of output and calculations in C++
- A program that simulates a resturant where the user can input how many of each burger was sold and then calculates the total profits for the day. This helped me learn about user input and calculations in C++
- A program that simulates the tossing of a coin where the user enters heads or tails and teh program determines if you win or lose. This helped me learn about randomisation in C++ as well as IF statements.
- A program that allows the user to enter a number of tons and converts it to pounds and kilograms in a table format. This required me to learn how to use functions in a C++ program and i also had to use loops.
- A program that creates an isoceles triangle object and shows the area and perimeter of it after the user enters the base and height of the triangle. This was a very important program for me beacuse i learnt about classes, objects and constructors.
- A program that checks if a user inputted number is equal to one of the 'lottery numbers' which is an array stored in this program. This gave me a better understanding of arrays and checking if something is in a array.
- A program that takes user inputted test scores and stores them in an array it then sorts the scores in asecnding order and finds the average and displays both the user can also choose the size of an array. This required me to learn how to sort in C++ and use pointers.

These are just a few examples of small programs i have made so far which has helped me understand the fundamentals of C++ and has allowed me to learn numerous techniques
